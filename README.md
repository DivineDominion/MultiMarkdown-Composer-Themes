# MultiMarkdown-Composer-Themes
Themes for MultiMarkdown Composer v 3 (They should basically work on v 2 as well.)

**Note:** The old "Style Sheets" have been officially renamed "Themes" for MultiMarkdown Composer v 3.  The name contributed to some confusion and difficulty disambiguating Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and MultiMarkdown Composer's Style Sheets.  I'm trying to be consistent about using the word "Theme" to refer to the files that describe customizing the appearance of MultiMarkdown Composer, including the editor, sidebars, preview, etc.  The file format is basically the same, but there are some slight differences.  A v2 style sheet can be used in Composer v3, and a v3 theme can be used in v2 (more or less).  The file extension does need to be changed, however.  (`.style` for v2, and `.theme` for v3).

The "Empty.theme" is a template that can be used to create new ones, or simply modify an existing theme that you like.
